## 🧪 Passwords Tested

| Password            | Length | Complexity                  | Tool Used                 | Strength / Time to Crack             |
|---------------------|--------|-----------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `hello123`          | 8      | lowercase + numbers         | passwordmeter.com         | Weak (Score: 20%)                    |
| `Hello123!`         | 9      | Uppercase, lowercase, digit, symbol | howsecureismypassword.net | 3 hours                              |
| `HeLlo_19@Ka`       | 11     | Mixed case, symbol, number  | passwordmeter.com         | Strong (Score: 85%)                  |
| `p@S5!uP$Xz@9kLQ8`  | 16     | High entropy, all character sets | howsecureismypassword.net | Over 10 trillion years               |

## ✅ Best Practices Identified

- Use **at least 12–16 characters**
- Mix **uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols**
- Avoid **dictionary words** and **personal info**
- Do not reuse passwords across websites
- Use **password managers** to generate/store passwords
- Avoid sequences (e.g., `1234`, `abcd`) or repeated characters

## 📚 Common Password Attacks

| Attack Type            | Description                                                                 |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Brute Force**        | Tries all possible combinations                                              |
| **Dictionary Attack**  | Tries words from a list of common or leaked passwords                       |
| **Phishing**           | Tricks users into revealing passwords via fake websites or emails           |
| **Credential Stuffing**| Reuses leaked passwords across multiple websites                            |
| **Keylogging**         | Malware that records keystrokes to steal credentials                        |

## 🔐 Summary

Password complexity significantly improves security. While simple passwords can be cracked in seconds, strong passwords with length and variety in character types can take **millions or trillions of years** to crack. This makes them resilient against brute-force and dictionary attacks.
